# Lab2
## An assignment to make an "About Me" page.

This started as a website with some HTML and CSS, adding in Javascript with feature tasks.
Also, was a lesson in creating the file in Github, taking it throught the terminal to VS Code.

The part 2 of this assignment has been adding more HTML and CSS, and loops and arrays to the page.
